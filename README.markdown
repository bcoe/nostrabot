* We need something to grab in apocalyptic news stories.
* I'll probably want a list of words that sound terrifying, like nuclear.
* I will want something that pulls news in from a few news sources, perhaps just a simple RSS reader.
* We'll want something that tweets appropriate stores using the twitter API.

* RSS Reader.
* Story Chooser.
* Tweeter.
